  <div class="stackedit__html"><p>My name is Fox McCloud, leader of StarFox — a group of space mercenaries. Just days ago, I got a tip on an illegal drug transaction; not our usual business, but StarWolf — a group of criminal bounty hunters — was supposedly involved, and this was the perfect opportunity to take down Wolf- no, all of StarWolf. To that end, I decided to ambush them and went to the location of the transaction: an abandoned warehouse in the middle of the night.</p>
<p><br>
The first thing I noticed entering the warehouse was a strange smell reminiscent of cleaning agents. Perhaps this place was used often, so they kept it sanitized to remove any evidence? It for sure worked; I couldn’t sniff out anyone’s smell.</p>
<p>After finding a good hiding spot, I stood in wait for Wolf to show himself. Then, I’d jump out with my blaster and…- Well, my plan was solid enough in my mind, but I hadn’t been told when the exchange would be taking place, so I spent a long time waiting; I begna to regret not having gone to the bathroom before heading out…</p>
<p>Hours later, two people walked in from opposite sides. If I were to be successful, I had to be patient… The moment I saw them converse and drop their guard, I enacted my plan.</p>
<p>Jumping out with my blaster aimed at them, I shouted, “Hands in the air!” They complied immediately, still carrying cash and goods in their hands. I turned on the flashlight on my blaster, but neither of them seemed to be Wolf. Damn it.</p>
<p>I walked closer to them and ordered them, “Drop the goods and get down on the ground with your hands on your head.” It seemed they were just about to comply when purple plasma shot struck my blaster, knocking it out of my hand…and out of commission for good, most likely. While I was distracted, looking for my attacker, the two others immediately scurried away, dropping their goods in the rush.</p>
<p>I looked carefully in the direction of the shot, but since I hadn’t a flashlight anymore, I couldn’t see very well. I tried to sniff him out, but the smell of cleaning agents pervaded the warehouse. I felt a sudden tingle in my spine, and just as I turned around, a capture device flew straight at me, binding me in coils of steel-like rope. Damn it!</p>
<p>“Well well well, if it isn’t StarDork… And just the dork I’d been hoping to catch!” From the dark of the warehouse, a familiar male voice spoke, though my addled snout meant i couldn’t recognize him by smell. I struggled against my bindings, but they wouldn’t budge one bit. The man stepped out from the dark, and it turned out to be none other than…</p>
<p>“Wolf! I knew you were behind this!”</p>
<p>He looked at me with the biggest shit eating grin I’d ever seen. “But of course. I’m surprised it was that easy to fool you, Dork McCloud. Like father, like son, as they say.”</p>
<p>I glared back at him. “You sure love the sound of your own voice, don’t you? Just about the only one in Lylat who does, I reckon.” I fidgeted around to try and activate the emergency caller in my pocket. I felt a small click. Yes! It shouldn’t be long before my team would arrive at my location…I just had to keep him distracted with banter until then.</p>
<p>“Big words for a small fox. You’re lucky I’m in a good mood, or I’d have stomped your skull broken.” He stomped with his boot for emphasis, the sound echoing loudly throughout the warehouse. I flinched, recalling just how…cruel Wolf had been to kidnap victims in the past…oh god, what was he even planning to do with me?</p>
<p>“Of course, it’d be quite fitting were I to take you out now, but I’ve got plans with you for tonight, pup.” He grabbed the dropped bottle of drugs from the floor. “Better hope James taught you how to swallow pills.”</p>
<p>“What are those even?!”</p>
<p>“Why the hell would I know? I’m just a hired guard. All I know is that it’s gonna fuck you up real good; let’s find out how, shall we?” He shook the bottle, listening to the pills inside with sadistic glee.</p>
<p>“Fat chance, Wolf.” I said that, of course, but due to my bindings, all I could really do was keep my mouth shut…which meant I wouldn’t be able to keep him distracted with further banter while I waited for my team to save me.</p>
<p>He poured out a couple of pills in his hand, at which point I kept my mouth shut tight.</p>
<p>“Going all quiet on me now, are you pup? All bark and no bite, like always.” He walked up to me with slow, deliberate steps. His boots echoed loudly throughout the warehouse with every step, adding to my tension. Whatever those drugs did, hopefully I would never ever find out.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn’t that easy. With a  grin on his face, Wolf stomped on my balls and stuffed my mouth with the pills when I screamed out in pain. The nausea in my stomach was then so great that I could barely spit them out with what little breath I had left.</p>
<p>“There we go, pup. If you’d just done as I said, I wouldn’t have had to do that, you know.” Despite that, he looked as though he’d enjoyed it immensely.</p>
<p>“Why don’t I help you swallow them?” He procured a washcloth and a bottle of water, placed the washcloth on my face…and started waterboarding me like it was routine for him. It probably was, all things considered. Water poured into my nose and throat, and I began choking and thrashing around helplessly trying to breathe. Eventually as I became light-headed, I admitted defeat and swallowed the pills — at least the water helped with that. Once he saw me gulp them down, he removed the wet washcloth, letting me gasp for fresh air in between struggled chokes.</p>
<p>“See? Dumb little pups like you ought to just do what you’re told — or you’ll end up getting waterboarded. Don’t think I won’t do it again next time.” Again, his face belied the words he spoke. W-wait, next time?!</p>
<p>“W-what do you mean?! What are you planning to do with me!” Wolf simply smiled at me without a word, further inducing fear within me. I tried to struggle in my bindings once more, but as much as I wanted to make a valiant effort, I still felt sick after the ball-stomp from earlier, and I looked quite pathetic in hindsight.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of me wriggling around quietly like a fish out of water — mostly because he was content watching me in silence, and I felt too sick to banter back — he spoke and asked, “Well, how are you feeling, pup? I’m mighty curious what those pills do. I’ve still half a bottle with your name on it for another time…”</p>
<p>I didn’t respond, mostly because I didn’t really know myself yet. I then felt a warm, wet sensation on my lower body, and before I knew what was happening, Wolf started bellowing out in laughter.</p>
<p>“Holy shit, pup! Did you just piss yourself!?”</p>
<p>I felt my stomach churn as i looked down and saw myself laying in a still-expanding puddle of my own urine. I couldn’t even feel it happening! I knew I had to go earlier but— wait, could this be—</p>
<p>“Either you’re really scared of the big bad Wolf, or we’ve just found out what these drugs do. I’d better get your some diapers once I take you home to the base”</p>
<p>I wanted to cry. And I did, eliciting further humiliations and laughs from Wolf. Please, guys…find me, quickly…—</p>
<p>“Oh, right pup. I guess all your tech’s probably fucked by all this piss. Don’t think I didn’t notice you sending an emergency signal.”</p>
<p>I felt my heart drop. But, but the could still see where the signal came from, right? They should be here any minute! As long as I kept him here a little while longer, they’d come and save me!</p>
<p>“Welp, I don’t want you thrashing all over the place and getting piss on my uniform.” He wrung dry the washcloth from earlier and poured a clear liquid in it with a bottle from his pocket. The stench of piss meant I couldn’t smell what it was, but it wasn’t long before he helped me find out by placing it against my face.</p>
<p>I tried holding my breath. Whatever it was, it wouldn’t be a good idea to inhale. But soon my lungs gave out, and with each inhale, I felt myself going weak and limp as my eyes struggled to stay open.</p>
<p>“Nighty night, piddle-pup…”</p>
<hr>
<p>The rest of StarFox arrived just a few minutes too late, and all they could find was a trail of urine on the warehouse floor, leading to a puddle with strands of my fur in it. After a week or so of searching however, there were no further leads, and it soon became apparent I’d vanished without a trace. Months later, they had still not lost hope, but they knew that the odds of finding me were becoming slim to none.</p>
<p>As for what happened to me after…I don’t want to talk about it. Please don’t try to imagine what happened either. My life has been turned into endless humiliation and embarrassment… And it’s all thanks to that jerk, Wolf o’Donnell…</p>
<p>“Hey piddle-pup, why are you looking so grumpy? I just changed your diaper half an hour ago.”</p>
<p>I looked away in dejection. It’d been months now, but I swore to myself I’d never become complacent. I’d never break. One day, surely, my team would come and save me from the pampering clutches of Wolf…</p>
<p>“Aww, trying to act all though again, are we? I’ve got something just to fix that.”</p>
<p>Before I could shut my mouth, he stuffed in my mouth a pacifier with a sweet substance within, gradually leaking out into my mouth. It wasn’t long before I felt my body getting weak, my thoughts going hazy, and my bladder going…Nnngh…</p>
<p>“That’s more like it. This stuff’s way stronger than those pills, and much better at keeping you quiet; don’t you think so too, piddle-pup?”</p>
